## Introduction

Version control systems are essential for managing and tracking changes in projects, especially in software development. They allow teams to collaborate effectively, maintain a history of modifications, and ensure that previous versions of a project can be restored if needed. Git, one of the most popular version control systems, is widely used for its distributed architecture and robust feature set.

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes, collaborate, and manage codebases efficiently. This post covers frequently used commands and their purposes.

## Setting Up a Repository

### Initialize a New Repository

```bash
git init
```

This command initializes a new Git repository in your current directory.

### Clone an Existing Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Clones a repository into a new directory.

## Basic Commands

### Check Repository Status

```bash
git status
```

Displays the state of the working directory and staging area.

### Add Files to Staging Area

```bash
git add <file-name>
```

Stages specific files for commit.

```bash
git add .
```

Stages all changes in the current directory.

### Commit Changes

```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

Records changes in the repository with a message describing the update.

### View Commit History

```bash
git log
```

Shows the history of commits in the current branch.

## Branch Management

### Create a New Branch

```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

Creates a new branch.

### Switch Between Branches

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Switches to the specified branch.

### Merge Branches

```bash
git merge <branch-name>
```

Merges the specified branch into the current branch.

### Delete a Branch

```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

Deletes the specified branch.

## Working with Remote Repositories

### Add a Remote Repository

```bash
git remote add origin <repository-url>
```

Links a local repository to a remote repository.

### Push Changes to Remote

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

Pushes the committed changes to the specified branch on the remote repository.

### Pull Changes from Remote

```bash
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository into the current branch.

### Fetch Changes Without Merging

```bash
git fetch origin
```

Retrieves changes from the remote repository without merging them.
