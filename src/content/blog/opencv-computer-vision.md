- **imgproc:** Focuses on image processing functions, including transformations, filtering, morphological operations, and color space conversions.
- **video:** Includes motion analysis and tracking algorithms, such as optical flow and background subtraction.
- **calib3d:** Provides functions for camera calibration, stereo vision, and 3D reconstruction.
- **features2d:** Contains feature detection and descriptor algorithms like SIFT, SURF, ORB, and FAST.
- **objdetect:** Used for object detection, including face and eye detection using Haar cascades and deep learning-based detectors.
- **ml:** Implements machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, and k-means clustering.
- **highgui:** Manages input/output operations, including image and video display using GUI windows.
- **dnn:** Enables the use of deep learning models for object detection, classification, and segmentation using popular frameworks like TensorFlow, Caffe, and ONNX.

Each module consists of multiple functions and methods, making OpenCV a flexible and scalable library for a wide range of applications.

### **Getting Started with OpenCV**

To begin using OpenCV, you need to install it. There are different ways to install OpenCV based on your requirements:

#### **1. Installing OpenCV using pip (Basic Installation)**

If you are using Python, you can install OpenCV easily using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

This installs the core OpenCV functionality without additional dependencies such as contrib modules.

#### **2. Installing OpenCV with Contrib Modules**

If you need extra functionalities such as SIFT, SURF, and other advanced algorithms, install the contrib package:

```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
```

#### **3. Installing OpenCV from Source (Recommended for Advanced Users)**

For full control over the installation and to enable optimizations like CUDA, you can build OpenCV from source:

```bash
# Install dependencies (Ubuntu example)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git pkg-config \
    libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev libpng-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev \
    libv4l-dev libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libgtk-3-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran python3-dev

# Clone OpenCV repositories
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git

# Create a build directory
cd opencv && mkdir build && cd build

# Configure the build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
      -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib/modules ..

# Compile OpenCV
make -j$(nproc)

# Install OpenCV
sudo make install
```

#### **4. Installing OpenCV for Specific Environments**

- **For Jupyter Notebook:** Ensure that OpenCV is installed in the same environment as Jupyter:
  
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python jupyterlab
  ```
  
- **For Virtual Environments (venv or conda):**
  - Using venv:

    ```bash
    python -m venv opencv_env
    source opencv_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `opencv_env\Scripts\activate`
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

  - Using Conda:

    ```bash
    conda create -n opencv_env python=3.8
    conda activate opencv_env
    conda install -c conda-forge opencv
    ```

### **Verifying GPU Installation in OpenCV**

If you have installed OpenCV with GPU support (CUDA), you can verify that the installation is correctly configured using the following Python script:

```python
import cv2

# Check if OpenCV is compiled with CUDA support
print("CUDA Available:", cv2.cuda.getCudaEnabledDeviceCount() > 0)

# Print the number of available CUDA devices
print("Number of CUDA devices:", cv2.cuda.getCudaEnabledDeviceCount())
```

If the output indicates that CUDA is available and lists one or more devices, then OpenCV has been successfully configured with GPU support.

### **Common Applications of OpenCV with Code Examples**

- **Face Recognition:** Used in security and authentication systems.

    ```python
    import cv2

    # Load the cascade classifier
    face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

    # Load the image
    img = cv2.imread('face.jpg')
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Detect faces
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 4)

    # Draw rectangles around the faces
    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
            cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (255, 0, 0), 2)

    # Display the output
    cv2.imshow('img', img)
    cv2.waitKey()
    ```

- **Medical Imaging:** Helps in diagnosing diseases through image analysis.

    ```python
    import cv2
    import numpy as np

    # Load the image
    img = cv2.imread('medical_image.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

    # Apply Gaussian blur
    blurred_img = cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (5, 5), 0)

    # Apply thresholding
    _, threshold_img = cv2.threshold(blurred_img, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

    # Display the output
    cv2.imshow('Original', img)
    cv2.imshow('Thresholded', threshold_img)
    cv2.waitKey()
    ```

- **Autonomous Vehicles:** Assists in lane detection and object recognition.

    ```python
    import cv2
    import numpy as np

    # Load the video
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture('road_video.mp4')

    while(cap.isOpened()):
            ret, frame = cap.read()
            if not ret:
                    break

            # Convert to grayscale
            gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

            # Apply edge detection
            edges = cv2.Canny(gray, 50, 150)

            # Define region of interest
            height, width = frame.shape[:2]
            mask = np.zeros_like(edges)
            polygon = np.array([[(0, height), (width, height), (width, height//2), (0, height//2)]], np.int32)
            cv2.fillPoly(mask, polygon, 255)
            masked_edges = cv2.bitwise_and(edges, mask)

            # Apply Hough transform to detect lines
            lines = cv2.HoughLinesP(masked_edges, 1, np.pi/180, 20, minLineLength=20, maxLineGap=300)

            # Draw lines on the frame
            if lines is not None:
                    for line in lines:
                            x1, y1, x2, y2 = line[0]
                            cv2.line(frame, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 3)

            # Display the output
            cv2.imshow('Frame', frame)
            if cv2.waitKey(25) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
                    break

    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    ```

- **Augmented Reality (AR):** Used for overlaying virtual objects in real-world environments.

    ```python
    import cv2
    import numpy as np

    # Load the video
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

    # Load the overlay image
    overlay = cv2.imread('overlay.png', cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED)

    while(cap.isOpened()):
            ret, frame = cap.read()
            if not ret:
                    break

            # Resize overlay to fit the frame
            overlay = cv2.resize(overlay, (frame.shape[1], frame.shape[0]))

            # Extract the alpha channel from the overlay
            alpha = overlay[:, :, 3] / 255.0
            alpha_inv = 1.0 - alpha

            # Overlay the image
            for c in range(0, 3):
                    frame[:, :, c] = (alpha * overlay[:, :, c] + alpha_inv * frame[:, :, c])

            # Display the output
            cv2.imshow('AR', frame)
            if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
                    break

    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    ```

- **Motion Detection:** Essential for surveillance and tracking applications.

    ```python
    import cv2

    # Load the video
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture('surveillance_video.mp4')

    # Read the first frame
    ret, frame1 = cap.read()
    gray1 = cv2.cvtColor(frame1, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    gray1 = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray1, (21, 21), 0)

    while(cap.isOpened()):
            ret, frame2 = cap.read()
            if not ret:
                    break

            gray2 = cv2.cvtColor(frame2, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
            gray2 = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray2, (21, 21), 0)

            # Compute the absolute difference
            delta = cv2.absdiff(gray1, gray2)
            thresh = cv2.threshold(delta, 25, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)[1]

            # Dilate the thresholded image to fill in holes
            thresh = cv2.dilate(thresh, None, iterations=2)

            # Find contours
            contours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh.copy(), cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

            # Draw bounding boxes around moving objects
            for contour in contours:
                    if cv2.contourArea(contour) < 500:
                            continue
                    (x, y, w, h) = cv2.boundingRect(contour)
                    cv2.rectangle(frame2, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

            # Display the output
            cv2.imshow('Motion Detection', frame2)
            gray1 = gray2.copy()

            if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
                    break

    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    ```
